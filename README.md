## Find postgraduate teacher training courses service

The live service lives at:<br />
* http://find-postgraduate-teacher-training.education.gov.uk/
* https://github.com/DFE-Digital/search-and-compare-ui

Design history of the frontend at:<br />
* https://search-and-compare.herokuapp.com/history

## Change the provider in the prototype

* Copy `courses-clean.json` from [courses-clean.zip](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/search-and-compare-data/blob/master/courses-clean.zip) in the search-and-compare-data repo to this repo (itâ€™s in .gitignore already)
* Set the `provider` in [generate.rb](https://github.com/fofr/manage-courses-prototype/blob/master/generate.rb#L9) to the name of the provider in UCAS
* Run the ruby script: `./generate.rb`, which generates a new `prototype_data.json` file
* Commit the changes to master, which auto-deploys to Heroku
