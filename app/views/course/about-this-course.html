          <li>how much time they’ll spend in each school</li>
          <li>if mentors are available within the schools</li>
          <li>the average distance candidates have to travel from home to school</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You could also mention:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>the age ranges taught (eg 11 to 16 or 11 to 18)</li>
          <li>how many schools you partner with in total</li>
          <li>whether candidates are able to change schools</li>
          <li>how placement schools are selected</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We show guidance in this section. It tells candidates:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>where your school placements are</li>
          <li>that they will be placed in different schools</li>
          <li>that you will take their commute into account</li>

          <p>You’ll be placed in schools for most of your course. This university is based in <mark>[show provider location(s)]</mark>, and your school placements will be within commuting distance.</p>

          <p>You can’t pick which schools you want to be in, but your university will try to take your journey time into consideration.<p>

          <p>Universities can work with over 100 potential placement schools. Most will be within 10 miles of the university, but sometimes they can cover a wider area, especially outside of cities.</p>
