        We’ve imported your training courses from UCAS
      </h1>

      <p>We found {{ data['ucasCourses'].length }} courses belonging to {{ data['training-provider-name'] }}.</p>

      <p>Check that your course information is correct. If there are any mistakes, you should contact Become a Teacher to let us know.</p>
      <p>To make any changes, for now you’ll still need to use UCAS web-link. Changes on UCAS will normally show here within one working day. </p>

      <p>Soon you’ll be able to add extra content to tell applicants more about you and your courses.</p>
