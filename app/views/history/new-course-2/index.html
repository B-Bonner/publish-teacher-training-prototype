      <p>This design <a href="/history/new-course">tweaks the previous wizard</a> so that:</p>

      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>fees and salary have their own page</li>
        <li>there’s a route into creating a course</li>
        <li>course creation has a success message</li>
        <li>the created course page has no UCAS section</li>
        <li>there’s a read only course information section</li>
        <li>the confirm page only shows parts relevant to the journey taken</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="user-research">User research</h2>

      <p>We tested the shortest path with 2 providers. This excluded language, training location, fee and salary and accredited provider screens.</p>

      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li><a href="https://lookback.io/watch/veykZkMozQtCAvceD">Keele and North Staffordshire Education</a> (<a href="https://lookback.io/watch/gKCGDj8zDhCiqwQ77">alternative version</a>)</li>
        <li><a href="https://lookback.io/watch/gYu2aoCo3PWyaJEHH">University of Wolverhampton</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Providers found adding a new course easy to do:</p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li><a href="https://lookback.io/watch/gKCGDj8zDhCiqwQ77?t=1h15m15s">“It’s an easier to use system, seemed quicker”</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://lookback.io/watch/gYu2aoCo3PWyaJEHH?t=50m26.78s">“This looks much clearer”</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Course codes</h3>

      <p>Keele told us stories of users applying for the wrong course because they had the wrong course code. Many of them are different by 1 digit. <a href="https://lookback.io/watch/gKCGDj8zDhCiqwQ77?t=28m46s">They are too hard to differentiate</a>.</p>

      <p>They want the course codes to be more clearly related to a provider: <a href="https://lookback.io/watch/gKCGDj8zDhCiqwQ77?t=29m7s">“Can the codes be related to a provider? … We use KNST a lot”</a></p>

      <p>The University of Wolverhampton have UCAS course codes but also use their own internal codes which cover postgraduate and undergraduate courses. They are longer (eg <a href="https://courses.wlv.ac.uk/course.asp?code=SE016P01UVG">SE016P01UVG</a>) and don’t appear to be surfaced to candidates.</p>

      <p><a href="https://lookback.io/watch/gYu2aoCo3PWyaJEHH?t=18m19.94s">Some courses are known by their codes</a>, perhaps because they’ve had the same code for a long time. This suggests that changing codes for existing courses might create a new mental burden for providers.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Modular, or not modular?</h3>

      <p>Keele said, <a href="https://lookback.io/watch/gKCGDj8zDhCiqwQ77?t=1h12m24s">“Ours is always no, we don’t do a modular course … I don’t know how it’d make a difference … We’ve never done it, we’ve never looked into what it means … If we don’t understand, how will candidates know?”</a></p>

      <p>University of Wolverhampton said, <a href="https://lookback.io/watch/gYu2aoCo3PWyaJEHH?t=49m3.97s">“Ours are all modular … we have 6x 20 credit modules … I think that can be explained through the blurb [though]”</a></p>
