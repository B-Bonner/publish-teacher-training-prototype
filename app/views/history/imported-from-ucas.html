      <h2 class="heading-large">Folding multiple UCAS courses into&nbsp;one</h2>
      <p>Try having one page per subject/provider combination. One search result and page per provider gives a space to explain the different preferences or options available for that provider. <a href="https://trello.com/c/RmjRaDkC/8-one-search-result-and-page-per-provider-gives-a-space-to-explain-the-different-preferences-or-options-available-for-that-provide">Untested hypothesis</a>: Users are making a choice about who will provide their course. Then expressing a preference.</p>

      <p>Attempt to fold:</p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>qualification options (sometimes split on UCAS, sometimes misrepresented)</li>
        <li>salary options (represented by a separate school direct salaried route)</li>
        <li>accrediting provider if multiple (course details may vary too much to do this)</li>
        <li>multiple school direct courses per school into one with all schools</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">Unfolding for apply</h3>
      <p>We need to communicate how to apply to a variant accurately. eg Which school is available for what, what does and does not have vacancies, what the course codes are – if the choice is represented on UCAS as a separate course.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">Problems folding schools</h3>
      <p>If there are schools for a salaried course and different schools for unsalaried, how can that be represented? When we show "4 miles to nearest school" in search results, that may not be for a salaried school – prescient if a user has filtered by salary.</p>
