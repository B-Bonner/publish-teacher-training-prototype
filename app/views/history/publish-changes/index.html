      <p>Designs for the different states content can be in, for both courses and organisation information.</p>

      <p>These designs represent a minimum viable workflow, they separate the save action from the publish action.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">User needs</h3>

      <p>As a user I need to publish content so that applicants can see it.</p>

      <p>As a user I need to save changes without immediately publishing them so that I can check or preview content, ask for a review, or make corrections, before applicants see that content.</p>

      <p>As a user I need to know when there are unpublished changes so that I can publish them.</p>

      <p>We expect to discover further needs in research that can be prioritised and addressed in later iterations, such as:</p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>needing to see what has changed since the last published version</li>
        <li>needing to see a history of all published changes</li>
        <li>needing to revert a draft back to a published state</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">Validation</h3>
      <p>Validate against word count when saving.</p>
      <p>Validate all required fields have been completed before publishing.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">No QA in this flow</h3>
      <p>We originally expected to build a <a href="/history/qa-draft">quality assurance (QA) review step</a> into the publishing workflow. But given the complexity of building this flow and the volume of courses needing approval, we switched to a ‘spot-check’ approach, where we will review a sample of all published content.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">State</h3>
      <p>A course or the ‘About your organisation’ section can be in one of these states:</p>

      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>New: The fields are all empty</li>
        <li>Draft: The fields have been edited and those changes have not been published</li>
        <li>Published: The fields have been published and no subsequent edits have been made.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">Design notes</h3>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>Indicate when there are unpublished changes</li>
        <li>Hide the publish action from content in published state</li>
        <li>Once published, indicate the last publish date, ‘last’ differentiates from ‘first published’</li>
        <li>Keep preview and publish actions in ‘new’ state for familiarisation</li>
        <li>Include a view on website link to see what the live version looks like, must be distinguished from preview</li>
        <li>Explain what preview is and why it’s useful – we’ve observed confusion about preview in research</li>
      </ul>

  <div class="grid-row">
    <div class="column-two-thirds">
      <h3 class="heading-medium">A course will already be published</h3>
      <p>The difference between a course and organisation information is that a course already exists in a published state. We publish the minimum course details automatically so that the course is findable, even if the training provider doesn’t log in and enrich their course.</p>

      <p>We need to accurately distinguish the difference between automatic publishing of changes made on UCAS vs the publishing of enriched course content. There is a risk that ‘Last published on’ can be misinterpreted.</p>

      <p>The ‘Last published on’ date should be the date that the course content was last published. It is not when UCAS content changes, or when organisation information was updated.</p>


      <h3 class="heading-medium">View on website vs preview</h3>
      <p>In these designs we show both preview and a link to view the live version of the content. These two views will look very similar and there's a risk that users will be confused by them. The two links are useful because they are the only way of comparing between live and draft.</p>

      <p>An alternative might be to move the ‘View on website’ link to the point of preview, perhaps as something like ‘View live version’.</p>
